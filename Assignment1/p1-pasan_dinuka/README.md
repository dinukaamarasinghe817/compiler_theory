# The Code was created on windows using WSL
# The Code was tested on linux

# Instruction to execute the code
    i.  open the terminal and navigate to current directory

    ii. In the terminal type 'make run' and hit enter

    iii.Change the code in the 'input' file as desired and redo step (ii) and check the output.

# Special facts about the submission

    i.  there is no maximum limit of variables since it's using a linked list as the symbol table

    ii. Error checking has been done for these errors

        - Use before declaring
        - Use before initializing
        - Invalid type of operands for operators ( +, *, =)
        - Multiple declarations for the same variable name
        - Syntax errors

# There are certain limitations in the given compiler preparation

    i.  Only supports addition and multiplication arithmetic operations since those are the ones given as the syntax in the first page of the assignment. But the program can extend further to perform substraction and division operations as well.

    ii. Custom structures used in order to store names of variables and values of intermediate expressions.

    iii.Only supports 'int' and 'float' as variable types since those are the types given in the assignment instructions
    
    iv. The program tested and performed correctly for the given syntax rules and sample test cases.
